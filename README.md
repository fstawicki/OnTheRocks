Website displays information about cocktails using CocktailDB API. You can search drinks by their name and get a random drink. Website displays information such as: drink name, image, list of ingredients with measures, making instructions, prefered glass type and is it alcoholic or not.

During app creation I used mainly React and CSS Modules. In code I used solutions such as Context API and fetching using async await.
